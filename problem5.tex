\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Prove a polynomial of degree \(k\), \(a_kn^k + a_{k - 1}n^{k - 1} + \hdots
    + a_1n^1 + a_0n^0\) is a member of \(\Theta(n^k)\) where \(a_k \hdots a_0\)
    are nonnegative constants.

    \begin{proof}
        To prove that \(a_kn^k + a_{k - 1}n^{k - 1} + \hdots + a_1n^1 +
        a_0n^0\), we must show the following:

        \[
            \exists c_1 \exists c_2 \forall n \geq n_0,\ {c_1 \cdot g(n) \leq
            f(n) \leq c_2 \cdot g(n)}
        \]

        For the first inequality, it is easy to see that it holds because no
        matter what the constants are, \(n^k \leq a_kn^k + a_{k - 1}n^{k - 1} +
        \hdots + a_1n^1 + a_0n^0\) even if \(c_1 = 1\) and \(n_0 = 1\).  This
        is because \(n^k \leq c_1 \cdot a_kn^k\) for any nonnegative constant,
        \(c_1\) and \(a_k\).
        \\

        Taking the second inequality, we prove it in the following way.
        By summation, \(\sum\limits_{i=0}^k a_i\) will give us a new constant,
        \(A\). By taking this value of \(A\), we can then do the following:

        \[
            \begin{split}
                a_kn^k + a_{k - 1}n^{k - 1} + \hdots + a_1n^1 + a_0n^0 &=
                \\
                &\leq (a_k + a_{k - 1} \hdots a_1 + a_0) \cdot n^k
                \\
                &= A \cdot n^k
                \\
                &\leq c_2 \cdot n^k
            \end{split}
        \]

        where \(n_0 = 1\) and \(c_2 = A\). \(c_2\) is just a constant. Thus the
        proof is complete.
    \end{proof}
